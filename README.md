Antipodes Mapping Application
--------

This project contains an [antipode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes) app.  When the user taps somewhere on the map, it places a red pin at the tap point, then zooms to the opposite side of the planet and places blue pin on the corresponding antipode.

Code Refinement
---------------

Let's pretend that this app represents an initial proof-of-concept implementation. The objective of this exercise is to enhance its quality and prepare it for potential production deployment. This involves a refactoring process, considering aspects such as:

* Architectural Design: Evaluating and potentially restructuring the application for improved organization.
* Code Quality: Identifying and resolving any existing issues within the code.
* Readability and Maintainability
* Testing

We are interested in the decisions you make in fixing, refactoring, and improving the code. Feel free to rename variables, rewrite code, change patterns, change the application architecture, or any other aspect of the code.
